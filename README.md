# FreeEbooks üßø
![](https://img.shields.io/badge/FreeEbooks-Android-green)

FreeEbooks is a native android application to download ebooks from the project *GutenBerg*, it uses **GutenDex** API to fetch metadata of ebooks in the backend üóûÔ∏è  built using the modern android architecture components with MVVM Architecture üèó adhering to solid clean architecture principles. *Made with love ‚ù§Ô∏è by [Kuluruvineeth](https://github.com/kuluruvineeth)*

The app also uses *Google Books* API to fetch some extra data like book summary and pages count etc, as the GutenBerg project don't include those values in their metadata. It tries it's best to map the data received from Google books with Gutenberg's metadata but the mapping is not 100% accurate and not all books available on GutenBerg is also available on Google books or is available but with different title, so you may find some books without summary or page count etc.
